# vite + react + typescript + prettier + jest + storybook tutorial

I fixed the code in the [Storybook Tutorial](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/intro-to-storybook/react/en/contribute/) with Typescript.
This code works well.

## Quick start

1. Clone the repository

Run the following command to clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aJonghunPark/vite-react-ts-storybook-tutorial.git
```

2. Install the dependencies.

Navigate into your newly cloned repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```sh
cd vite-react-ts-storybook-tutorial

yarn install
```

3. Browse your stories.

Run yarn storybook to see your component's stories at http://localhost:6006
